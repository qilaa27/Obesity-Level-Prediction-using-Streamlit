# Obesity Level Prediction App

This project builds and deploys a **machine learning model** to predict an individual's **obesity level** based on lifestyle and daily habits.  
The goal is to support proactive health interventions by identifying people at higher risk of obesity.

The model was trained with full preprocessing and algorithm comparison, then deployed using  
**FastAPI** as the backend API and **Streamlit** as the interactive frontend.

**Input:** user data such as gender, age, height, weight, family history of overweight,  
dietary habits, physical activity, and other lifestyle factors from the provided CSV test cases.

**Output:** predicted obesity category

- **Test Case 1 → Overweight_Level_II (Code: 3)**
